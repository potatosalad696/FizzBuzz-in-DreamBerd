# FizzBuzz-in-DreamBerd
An attempt to make a FizzBuzz program in the **BEST** programming language ever made by humanity, ***DreamBerd***.
## How to Use
I recommend using [Vivaan's Interpreter](https://github.com/vivaansinghvi07/dreamberd-interpreter), although *theoretically* any DreamBerd interpreter should work.

Next, go to the src folder (the one that you just downloaded), and run ```dreamberd fizzbuzz.db```. Make sure you're _on_ a folder that contains the file.

### Notes
- ```sOutput = sOutput + "Rp{g_iIDX}"!```

  This line of code only works if you're Indonesian. You may need to change ```Rp``` to your country's currency.
- I just noticed that there's actually a FizzBuzz code in the example page. But that one doesn't work. So enjoy my version instead :)
